          Hi there! I am a frontend developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I have 3
          years of experience working in the tech industry, where I have
          developed a passion for software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in JavaScript,
          TypeScript, React and Next.JS, which have allowed me to deliver
          exceptional results on projects I have worked on. I have experience
          working with a range of tools and technologies, including Git,
          Webpack, Netlify, Vercel and Firebase.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited to bring my expertise to a new role and contribute to the
          success of the company.
        </p>
